Right, so this seems really confusing. So we are going to do a couple of things.

* Prove that sinₘ x is continuous
* Prove that sinₘ x is differentiable
* Prove that sinₘ x has a differential and its on the paper
* Do that for the rest of the trigonometric funcs

Firstly continuity! 

Basically its continuous ∀ c, limit f(x) as x → c = f(c)
However, we need limits!!

-- Slight problem, I have no idea how to do any of these things...
